How to fix the warning advertisment about default export

Instead of an unnamed default export:

import React from "react";
 
export default (props) => {
  ...
};

You can refactor to give your component a name:

import React from "react";
 
const Layout = (props) => {
  ...
};
export default Layout;

This will come up a few times throughout the rest of the course and can be handled similarly.

import React from "react";
 
const someComponent = () => {
  ...
};
export default someComponent;
